- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case your computer was stolen or your hard drive blows up!

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
 Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be changes you have made locally that you don't want to be
overwritten. There could be merge conflicts.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Fork: making a clone of a repository directly in your Github account
Clone: a duplicate repository made to your local machine
Branch: a separate path of changes and updates that can later be merged back
in to the main repository

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

So that you can work on the most up to date version of the project whilst
offline.
