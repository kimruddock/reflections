- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case your computer was stolen or your hard drive blows up!

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
 Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be changes you have made locally that you don't want to be
overwritten. There could be merge conflicts.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Fork: making a clone of a repository directly in your Github account
Clone: a duplicate repository made to your local machine
Branch: a separate path of changes and updates that can later be merged back
in to the main repository

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

So that you can work on the most up to date version of the project whilst
offline.

- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

The project could be uploaded to a central server by ftp and downloaded by
each person on the project when they need to work on it. Multiple versions
of the project could be stored to maintain some sort of history but this
could quickly use up server space if the project is very large.
