- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case your computer was stolen or your hard drive blows up!

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
 Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be changes you have made locally that you don't want to be
overwritten. There could be merge conflicts.
